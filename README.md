## Rootless nginx image for Kubernetes/Openshift

Supporting the OpenShift Community with Rootless Nginx Images

The open-source ecosystem thrives on choice and transparency. With Bitnami silently discontinuing their rootless Nginx image on Docker Hub, many OpenShift users were left without a trusted, non-root alternative.

We provide a fully maintained rootless Nginx image, ready for OpenShift and other non-root environments, helping developers continue building secure and compliant containerized applications.

If you find our work useful, you can support us via Razorpay. Your contribution helps keep this project free and accessible to the open-source community.
